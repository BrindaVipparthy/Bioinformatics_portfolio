# Bioinformatics Portfolio – Tools for Genome Analysis

This portfolio was created as part of the **Bioinformatics: Tools for Genome Analysis** course, and it showcases the use of various genome browser tools and bioinformatics databases applied throughout the class. It reflects work completed through graded homework, quizzes, exams, and discussion posts.

The course emphasized a deeper understanding of genomic topics such as **genome variation**, **gene identification**, and **sequence annotation**, with a focus on applying publicly available tools to interpret complex genomic data.

## 📘 Portfolio Overview

This portfolio highlights both the tools/databases used and the biological context in which they were applied during the course. The topics covered include:

- 🔍 **ORF Finder Tools** – Identification of open reading frames in nucleotide sequences
- 🧬 **CDS Analysis and Detection** – Methods to locate and understand coding sequence regions
- 📁 **File Formats** – Overview of common bioinformatics file types (FASTA, GFF, BED, etc.) and their specific uses
- 🌐 **UCSC Genome Browser** – Multiple applications and interpretations across assignments
- 🧫 **IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer)** – Analysis of different genome datasets
- 🧬 **Ensembl Tools** – Use of BioMart and the Ensembl Genome Browser for gene annotation and dataset filtering
- 🧪 **Galaxy Platform** – Hands-on experience with workflows and tools available in Galaxy for sequence analysis and data manipulation

## 📎 Included

- `BVipparthy_FinalPortfolio.pdf` – A comprehensive document summarizing all tools and topics above, supported by course-based examples.

## 💡 Purpose

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate familiarity with commonly used genomic analysis platforms and provide a foundation for further exploration and research in functional genomics and sequence-based investigations.
